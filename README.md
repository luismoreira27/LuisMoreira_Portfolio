# Luis Moreira's Portfolio

## About

Hi, I’m Luís. I have a background in Biochemistry and hold a Master’s degree in Computational Biology. Throughout my academic journey, I developed strong skills in laboratory techniques, data analysis, and the life sciences. These experiences also helped me build valuable soft skills that are highly transferable to a Data Analyst role.

During my Master’s program, I gained significant experience in programming and working with biological datasets. This allowed me to strengthen my abilities in data manipulation, analysis, and storytelling—skills that enable me to extract meaningful insights and answer complex questions from data.

In my free time, I enjoy activities such as reading and going to the gym. I'm also passionate about engaging in extracurricular initiatives, including co-founding a Junior Initiative during my time at university.

In this repository I showcase skills and projects related to my Data Analyst journey.

## Portfolio Projects

### E-Commerce Dataset Data Exploration

**Objective**: Explore the dataset to see what type of information we have available.

The code can be found [here](/projects/Load_and_Query_db.ipynb)

**Description**: This Dataset is related to E-Commerce Sales in 2010 and 2011. Using SQL with the package SQLite3 I was able to create a Database to store the data and also query and explore it.

**Results**: By exploring the data I found out what type of variables I was working with and, by creating groups, see how those variables relate to each other.


### E-Commerce Dataset Analysis

**Objective**: Found out the various information about how the sales behave in terms of country, time of year, time of day and type of item.

The code can be found [here](/projects/ecom_ana.ipynb)

**Description**: This Dataset is related to E-Commerce Sales in 2010 and 2011. Using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn I tried to understand how the sales behave in terms of country, time of year and time of day.

**Results**: After the analysis we can see that the country where there was more sales was the United Kingdom and the time of year was November. This can give the E-Commerce company an insight on where and when to invest more in marketing. Also with the plotting of the most sold items we can see what is the item that is bring more income.


### Sales Data Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze the data to see how the sales behave over time, country, customer segment and profit level.

The code can be found [here](/projects/Sales_data_analysis.ipynb)

**Description**: The dataset is an AI generated dataset with information of sales and customers. Using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn I tried to understand how the sales behave in terms of customer segment, country, product sales and profit. This type of analysis is useful to companies to see in which sector they should invest more either in stock or marketing.  

**Results**: After the analysis I could evaluate that the United States is the country with the most sales and also what were the most sold and more profitable products. In terms of what type  of customers the dataset contains, I found out that in terms of gender it is very even out and the most common age group is between 46 and 60 years old.

### Sales Dashboard
